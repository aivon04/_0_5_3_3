Ready Queue q1 has a priority level of 2. FCFS scheduling algorithm will be used for q1. Ready Queue q1 has a total of ten processes namely 
p1, p2, p3,p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9, and p10. The sequence of these processes represent their arrival order. for example, p1 arrives at the first and p10
arrives at the last in this list of processes. In "px y" format y refers to the CPU burst time for px.1
